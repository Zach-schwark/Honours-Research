#### Abstract
The inherent risks in commercial and personal lending, particularly in developing countries, pose significant challenges due to potential borrower defaults and complex financial landscapes. This research addresses these issues by employing Bayesian Networks to create loan structures that minimise risk for lenders while offering viable financing options for borrowers. By making use of score-based structure learning, Bayesian estimation and MAP inference, the most probable loan structures for a given borrower are identified. Our experiments demonstrate that structure learning approaches, specifically the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), K2, and BDs algorithms, consistently outperform random and tree-based methods across various dataset sizes. Additionally, the findings indicate that more detailed evidence lists enhance model performance. This research contributes a transparent and interpretable machine learning framework for financial decision-making, ultimately improving the lending process for both lenders and borrowers.
